## Lesson 2: Debugging Application Code

To overcome the error that you got in the previous lesson, now open your app inside Adobe Experience Cloud (ExC) Shell on the same Chrome Debug window: https://experience.adobe.com/?devMode=true#/apps/?localDevUrl=https://localhost:9080. You might be asked to log in using your Adobe ID. When opened, the UI is almost similar to that when you access it on localhost, except the ExC Shell on top.  

At this time, the action runs successfully, and you can see the response body of `hello` action in the browser console.

Let's try debugging this action. Go back to the Explorer View in VSCode, open the file `actions/hello/index.js`. At line 40, it makes a request to the Adobe I/O Runtime API docs at https://adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/api-docs.

```javascript
const apiEndpoint = 'https://adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/api-docs'
const res = await fetch(apiEndpoint)
```

You may want to debug what is returned from this API call to decide what to do next. To debug, you first need a breakpoint at line 40.

Go back to the Chrome Debug window, access the at inside ExC Shell if not already done: https://experience.adobe.com/?devMode=true#/apps/?localDevUrl=https://localhost:9080. Select the `hello` action and invoke. Your debugger would stop at the breakpoint you set earlier, which allows inspecting values of the variables in your code.

You can debug your UI code in the `web-src` folder in the same way as [debugging action code](lesson2.md). However, almost every browser comes with handy built-in debugging capabilities, you should leverage these to get the most out of it.  

Below is an example ran on Firefox.
